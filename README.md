This is a fork of the jsonui-scripting package version 2.0.2, created to be stored and reused when needed. I made this backup because version 2.0.2 is not yet available on npm and GitHub. This copy is shared completely free of charge and stored for the sole purpose of serving, without changing the ownership of the original. All ownership rights belong to the original author of the package, Asaki Yuki. Any further changes and developments should still be done on the original copy of the repository.
